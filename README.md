# Proto-Swarm
Python Code allows multiple robots to work together to traverse unknown environments, map the surroundings, and perform tasks autonomously while maintaining efficient communication and coordination.

## Function Design
The Robots deployed in the ‘PROTO-SWARM’ project require an extensive set of methods or functions to achieve their objectives. Functions such as Exploration, LIDAR to World Coordinates, Database, Map Generation, Obstacle Detection, and a helper module which contains a set of helper functions such as reverse, and rotate, etc. all contribute to various scenarios that the robots can respond to. 

The following paragraphs discuss each function:

### − clear_database
Clears the SQLite database by committing and closing any active connections.
This is a preparatory function to ensure a clean state before starting new
simulations. It is used before starting a simulation to ensure there is no residual
data in the database from previous runs.

### − init_db
Initializes the SQLite database with all possible coordinates within the defined
map boundaries based on the vertices which are the list of map boundary vertices
and resolution which is the size of each cell in meters. Marks all locations as
unvisited by default. Provides the base dataset for the robot's exploration process.
The robot updates the visited field as it explores.
### − update_visited
Marks a specific coordinate in the database as visited. It is used during exploration
to track which locations the robot has visited.
### − get_all_coordinates
Fetches all coordinates and their visited statuses from the database. It returns a list
of tuples in the format (x, y, z, visited), where visited is 0
(unvisited) or 1 (visited). It will be used to generate the real-time map and for
post-analysis of explored and unexplored areas.
### − generate_map
Creates a grid representation of the map and marks the visited locations based on
the database data. A 2D numpy array (grid) representing the map, with 1 for
visited cells and 0 for unvisited cells will the generated by this function which
will be used for visualizing the explored area of the map in real time.
### − lidar_to_world_coordinates
Converts raw LIDAR data into world coordinates of traversable points by
accounting for the robot's position and orientation. A list of world coordinates
(x, y) representing traversable points detected by the LIDAR. It is used to
identify new areas the robot can explore and update the database.
### − update_traversable_areas
Updates the database with traversable areas detected via LIDAR. The LIDAR data
and GPS data will be used to perform validations prior to updating the visited field
of the database. This will ensure that no unneeded record updates are executed
without proper checks and conditions.
### − plot_map_live
Plots the map in real time using data from the database. Displays visited and
unvisited areas visually by using a matplotlib live plot showing the explored map.
It will allow the user to analyse the robot’s exploration progress by providing a
visual representation of the areas traversed using the Matplotlib module.
### − reverse
Reverses the robot for a short duration to help it get unstuck. The robot moves
backward for a predefined time (REVERSE_DURATION). Used as part of the
obstacle avoidance logic to help the robot recover from being stuck.
### − rotate_left_90
Rotates the robot left by approximately 90 degrees to reorient it. Used in situations
where the robot needs to change its direction, especially when stuck or avoiding
obstacles.
### − avoid_obstacle
Uses LIDAR data to adjust the robot's movement and avoid collisions with
obstacles. Adjusts the robot’s motor speeds to steer away from obstacles. Essential
for safe navigation through the environment.
### − mark_visited
Marks the robot's current position as visited on the grid. Updates the grid to mark
the current position as visited. Maintains an up-to-date map of explored areas.
### − create_grid
Creates an empty grid based on map boundaries and resolution. An empty 2D
numpy array (grid) and Map boundaries (x_min, y_min, resolution) will serve
as the inputs for this function and will allow it to produce a template for marking
visited locations and generating the map.
### − calculate_coverage
Calculates the percentage of the map that has been explored. This float value
calculation will be displayed in the console and will be used to monitor the
progress of the exploration and determine when the task is complete.
### − explore
The main exploration function. It initializes the database, controls the robot’s
movement, updates the map, avoids obstacles, and manages the exploration
process. It is the main controller logic which will orchestrate all other functions
to achieve autonomous exploration of the environment.
